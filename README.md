## What does this datapack do?
This simple datapack makes it possible to mine ores like in versions before 1.17 again. That means that ores drop ores again and not raw ores.

## But whyy??
My friends and me noticed after playing the newer versions of Minecraft that the new ore logic is a bit overpowered and makes it much easier to get resources (especially Copper Ore)

## More Minecraft Versions??
I will support more Minecraft versions if it is requested. So if someone comments or opens an issue on GitHub that they want another version of Minecraft for this datapack, I will make it!
